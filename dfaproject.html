				<h1> Design for America: EduHomeless </h2>
				<img src="skills_icon.svg"  style="width:100px; height:100px; border:0;"">
				<p> EduHomeless is a project that is focused on empower homeless youth at UCSD and to be open about their needs. I was worked on this project with five other students from Design For America, a student organization that focuses on designing for social innovation. Over the course of the entire school year, roughly 30 weeks, we applied human-centered design principles to create a mural and a survey-based website to help centralize the user's needs. </p>

				<h3> Skills and Tools </h2>
				<p> Affinity Diagrams, Sketch, Prototyping, User Testing </p>

				<h2> The Problem </h2>
				<p> From the start, the team felt very strongly about how education and literacy played a huge role in the lives of homeless youth especially here on campus. San Diego has the 4th highest homeless youth population in the entire country so we wanted to do something that would leave a concrete, sustainable impact on our campus. </p>

						 </li>
						<li> How can we connect all the homeless youth services and admin aid on campus to make a more seamless and effective sharing of information for this group?
