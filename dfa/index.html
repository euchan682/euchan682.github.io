            <h2>CONCEPTUALIZATION——</h2> 

              <p><strong>Design for Housing Insecurity</strong> is a UCSD Design For America project focused on tackling the housing insecurity issue at UCSD. My co-lead, Andrew De La Roziere, led 8 other students, Dawn Ye, Sara Tan, Denzel Rodil, Rishabh Singhal, Rajiv Sancheti, Vanessa Machin, Viviana Davila, and Samuel Huang. In order to ensure that our team leaves an impact on the housing crisis, we worked with two community partners, Kevin Nicholson, the Off Campus Housing Coordinator, and The Hub, UCSD's Basic Needs Center. Currently, this is an ongoing project as we are working on transforming our insights from our user research phase into ideas that we can prototype.</p>
              <br>
              <p>UCSD's Design For America encourages students to use human-centered design to combat social issues occurring at UCSD and within the greater San Diego area. Design For America is an award winning student organization that began at Northwestern University and has over 40 design studios across the nation.</p>

            <h2>DESIGNING FOR HOUSING INSECURITY</h2>
            <h3>IDENTIFY</h3>

            <p> At the start of our project, my co-lead and I immediately knew we had to narrow down our scope since basic needs insecurity is so broad. Although most basic needs issues are intermingled, we knew that narrowing our scope is crucial in order for our design process to be more effective. We also chose to focus on housing insecurity because we had focused on food insecurity in our first year of this project, hoping to touch upon unexplored avenues. Our first step was to have each member conduct independent research, where we explored how other college campuses tackled similar issues and found relevant statistics that informed our current scope.</p>
            <br>

            <p>For example, in the 2018 University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey,</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>141 individuals, out of 7,653 UCSD responses, are homeless during the Fall-Spring academic year</li>
              <li>6,144 individuals, out of 7,816 UCSD responses, are sharing their housing with another student</li>
              <li>4,089 individuals, out of 7,813 UCSD responses, live a mile or greater from campus</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite the number of homeless indivudals being a minority, we understood that housing insecurity, broadly speaking,  encompasses a large number of unique situations. The UCSD Basic Needs Insecurity Committee Report defines housing insecurity as "unaffordable housing costs, overcrowding, poor housing quality, couch surfing, and homelessness". The above statistics are relevant to such issues and as such, we're crucial in identifying the social issue for our project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Other college campuses have also utilized unique methods of combatting basic needs insecurity, such as</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Donation of unused swipes and low rent co-op housing at UCSB</li>
              <li>The Doorway Project, a pilot cafe at the UW where homeless youth can engage with necessary tools and resources</li>
              <li>SDSU's Hunger and Homelessness Week, a week full of events to inform students about resources for food and housing insecurity</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Equipped with our initial research, we proceeded into the <strong>immerse phase</strong>, where we empathized with our stakeholders and uncover insights to better understand our problem space. Moving forward from the progress of last year's project my co-lead wanted to improve on areas where we felt we could have done better. We both agreed that we would like to put more emphasis on collaborating and communicating with our primary stakeholders, housing-insecure students. </p>


            <h3>IMMERSE</h3>
            <p>Our biggest challenge in engaging with our stakeholders, particularly housing-insecure students, is the stigma and connotations that are tied to identifying as housing-insecure. With this in mind, we took upon particularly aggressive measures to engage with as many users as possible. However, our other priority was also to extract rich, qualitative information so we also approached our data collection process with co-designing with our beneficiaries in mind. Ultimately, we arranged a focus group modeled meeting where we conduct flipped journey mapping exercies with each of our users.</p>
            <br>

            <p>For the recruitment process, we utilized:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Strategic placement of flyers</li>
              <li>Posting on social media, particualarly high-traffic Facebook student groups</li>
              <li>Guerilla recruitment, reaching out to people within our own circles and beyond</li>
            </ul>

            <img class="single" src="/assets/img/DFA Focus Group.png">

            </div>

            <h4>JOURNEY MAPPING</h4>

            <p>During the meeting, we began with the journey mapping exercise. Normally, the user would speak with a designer who would then illustrate the journey mapping according to the users' descriptions. However, we thought that it would be more appropriate and accurate if the user could map their own journey while the designer observes and discusses with the user, particularly because we wanted the user to illustrate their feelings too. We had each user map out a typical weekday, from the moment they rise till when they sleep, and illustrate any pain points they may have with commute, engaging in daily hygiene, or obtaining food. We'd later conclude the meeting with some discussion using questions that our community partner proposed while serving hot meals to our meeting participants.</p>

            <img class="single" src="/assets/img/journeymap.PNG">

            <div class ="pov">
              <p><strong>Sample journey map: one circle to illustrate  daily happenings and another to demonstrate users' emotions throughout the day</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>In total, we collected 15 journey maps from 15 students. We had a mixture of undergraduate and graduate students and a diverse set of housing situations: graduate housing, off-campus housing, on-campus housing, and homeless. We categorized them as such since we identified that each type are entitled to different amenities and would have varying experiences.</p>

            <h3>REFRAME</h3>
            <p>The most challenging part of this project thus far was this phase. Despite having such a wealth of information, it was very difficult to sort and process this information into insights that could be actionable. We spent several meetings categorizing our journey maps, identifying potential patterns, and making generalizations to help formulate our how can we statements (HCW). In addition, we also consulted with Design For America National Fellow, Irfan Ibrahim, to revise our statements to be more user-centric. Our 3 HCW are:</p>
            <br>

            <ol>
              <li>HCW give housing-insecure students more accessibility to sleeping spaces?</li>
              <li>HCW bring interacting among transient students more centralized and help them feel integrating into the broader student population? </li>
              <li>HCW help beneficiaries feel less-self-conscious when approaching resources?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>IDEATE</h3>

            <p>With our three HCW statements, our team practiced an ideation exercise where we simply generated as many as ideas, good or bad, within the span of minute. By the end of exercise, our table was covered in a rainbow of post-its. Afterwards, we use affinity mapping to discuss on what ideas seemed similar, and what we could expand upon for each of the three HCW statements.</p>

            <img class="double" src="/assets/img/ideate1.jpg">
            <img class="double" src="/assets/img/ideate2.jpg">
            <img class="double" src="/assets/img/ideate4.jpg">

            <div class ="pov">
              <p><strong>These were some of the post-its from our ideation exercise.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>We felt that we had a lot of ideas but it was hard to determine their viability and quantifiable measures of success. Per DFA National Fellow Irfan Ibrahim's suggestion, we undertook a prototyping exercise to determine which of the ideas had the best potential to deliver meaningful impact in a short yet significant amount of time.</p>

            <img class="single" src="/assets/img/prototype_planner.jpg">

            <div class ="pov">
              <p><strong>My prototype planner for a senior & student co-housing network.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>I was inspired by an interview I saw online where students shared a home with a senior citizen. There seemed to be a naturally symbiotic relationship: the tenant, young and able-bodied, helped with chores and became good friends with the older roommate. The older tenant benefited from a unique friendship that helped curb feelings of isolation. Through this interesting concept, young and old were brought together and many needs were met.</p>

            <br>

            <p>I thought that maybe a similar approach could be used to help housing-insecure students meet their most crucial need, a home. However, as I discussed with Irfan, and my studio lead, Eric Richards, I realized many assumptions were made and a lot of research still needed to be involved.</p>

            <br>

            <p>The biggest concern is attempting to involve seniors as part of the concept. A large part of this concept's viability relied on seniors being willing to open up their homes to strangers and develop a mutual trust in living and sharing a space with people they don't know. That being said, my team and I didnt't heavily focus on seniors during our user research stage mainly because our primary stakeholder are housing-insecure students. We were making a lot of assumptions on a different user group to help our target user group.</p>

            <p>After conducting our heuristic evaluation, we realized we had to make several changes under different heuristics for our timer study application. Here are some of the noted changes:</p>
            <div class="heuristic">
              <ul><p><strong>Show system status</strong></p>
                <li>Having an email confirmation dialog box pop-up to inform user that the app is aware of the user's purchase</li>
                <li>Displaying an estimate of points when user is setting the duration for their next study session so that they know how many points they will potentially earn</li>
              </ul>

              <ul><p><strong>Control & Freedom</strong></p>
                <li>Creating a history of past point earnings and study sessions to users can use it as a reference for future study sessions</li>
              </ul>

              <ul><p><strong>Error Prevention</strong></p>
                <li>Including a dialog box that confirms with user of their purchase to ensure user doesn't accidentally purchase a reward they didn't intend to buy</li>
              </ul>

              <ul><p><strong>Recognize, diagnose, & recover from errors</strong></p>
                <li>Including a dialog box indicating unfinished timer to inform user that their study session was interrupted and they won't earn the points for that productivity session</li>
                <li>Adding a "forget password" option so that users can recover their account if they forget their password</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>During the course of the heuristic evaluation, my team came to the conclusion that it was best to stick with a desktop user interface instead of a mobile one. The main reason we chose to stick with the desktop version of our web application is because one of the main core functionalities in our application is being able to track when a user is distracted: by clicking out of the current window and going to another window or tab. Since most people work from a desktop or a laptop,  and our application requires the user to stay focused on Focus, we thought it was best to not opt for mobile.</p>

            <h3>WIREFRAMING</h3>

            <p>While keeping note of the insights gained from our heuristic evaluation, I proceeded to wireframe our prototypes. Using Sketch, I made two simple, black and white wirefames our home page and timer page to convey the general user interface and display of our core functionality.</p>

            <img class="wireframe" src="/assets/img/Home.svg">
            
            <img class="wireframe" src="/assets/img/Timer.svg">

            <h3>HI-FIDELITY PROTOTYPING</h3>

            <p>Initially, I believed our wireframe would be of some resemblance to our eventual final product but as we approached the user testing phase, we quickly went through many more iterations of our user interface which dynamically changed the appearance and user experience of our application. We repeatedly polished and refined and incorporated new features that we didn't originally anticipate.</p>
            <br>

            <img class="wireframe" src="/assets/img/Home_iteration.svg">

            <p>As displayed in the iterations above, we rearranged the elements on our navigation bar as well as incorporated rotating inspirational quotes that will fade in and out at the bottom of the home page. We also added a settings and profile page for help and documentation that is accessed through the dropdown menu in the navigational bar. With each iteration, we were able to slowly realize our wireframe into the finished product we had in mind.</p>

            <h3>USER TESTING</h3>

            <p>My favorite part of the design process is user testing because it's always refreshing to listen to other people's feedback and see how their mental model differed from mine. For our COGS 120 course, we had to conduct several user tests on our target demographic and utilize their suggestions and comments to redesign a core feature of our application for qualitative A/B testing. My teammates and I used this opportunity to create a formal user testing protocol which composed of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Verbal script for each role in the user testing session (Task Guidance, Observer, Interviewer)</li>
              <li>Screen and audio recording materials</li>
              <li>Debrief interview</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During the actual user testing process we had each user</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Begin from the login page and proceed to create account with our application</li>
              <li>Create a study session for 1 minute and purchase a reward from the shop that would change the appearance of the app</li>
              <li>Change the appearance of the app back to its default settings</li>
            </ol> 

            <p>In our observations, we noticed that users didn't notice that the arrows used to adjust the timer were present and could help set the time. The main reason is because next to the timer we had presets of +/- 15 and 30 minutes and due to its bright green and red colors, people's attention were immediately directed to that. For example, one user during our user testing session selected the +30 min preset and then proceeded to press the "down" arrow on the minutes 29 times to set the timer for a 1 minute study session. In preparation for our qualitative A/B testing we took note of this breakdown and made it the focus of our redesign.</p>

            <img class="single" src="/assets/img/timer1.png">

            <p>Above is the timer user interface that users saw during the user testing session. The presets for adding 15 or 30 mins were in bright green while subtracting 15 or 30 mins were in red. This was <strong>version "A"</strong> for the A/B testing.</p>

            <iframe class="finalgif" src="https://giphy.com/embed/55tEKxYjWAXR9M9Qcz" width="700" height="400" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p></p>

            <p>Above is the timer user interface that we redesigned due to the breakdowns that we noticed during initial user testing trials. We animated the arrows to make them bounce to make them more noticable and eye-catching and matched the preset buttons to the overall color scheme. This was our <strong>version "B."</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>However, during our qualitative A/B testing, most people couldn't distinguish an immediate difference between our version "A" and "B". Several people still hovered over the presets first when trying to set the timer but after pointing out the newly added animations, people commented that they did find it somewhat useful because it definitely drew their attention. Ultimately, we kept both of our changes since the animated arrows proved to be less plain than before and the muted colors helped the presets to be less eye-catching.</p>

            <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>

            <p>Here is the polished final design of Focus, our desktop web application.</p>

            <img class="wireframe" src="/assets/img/Final_exp.svg">-

            <h3>THOUGHTS THUS FAR</h3>

            <p>Although this project is still ongoing, it's been 7 months since we began and in hindsight there are a lot of things that I've realized along the way. </p>
            <br>
            <p>It's possible that we should have utilized different user experience research techniques, but given time and logistic constraints, the focus group model seemed most suitable for our purposes at the time.</p>
            <p>The most rewarding part of this project so far is being able to meet and talk to the people you're trying to help with. Sometimes design can seem a little dehumanizing especially when one can get caught up in the details and is less focused on the bigger picture. It's easy to see the statistics, and to easily brush it off as if it's not a big deal. However, meeting students from all walks of life and listening as they share really intimate concerns about basic needs reminds me that looks really can be decieving. It's a very humbling experience as a person because you realize there is so much you don't know about and so many capacities where we should be more informed. </p> -->
