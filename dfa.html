					<h1>Design For America: Education for Homeless Youth</h1>

					<img src="dfalogo.png" style="float:center; border:0;"/>
					 <p> "Education for Homeless Youth" is a project that was started by UCSD's Design For America club members in the fall of 2017. Similar to Design For America's message, our team wanted to use design and social innovation to have a local impact on our community. Through some brief research, we learned that San Diego has the 4th highest homeless population in the nation and that one in four UCSD students skip meals on a regular basis. Because of this knowledge, our goal and purpose for this specific project is that we want to empower UCSD homeless youth to seek out appropriate resources and be more open about their needs.

								<li>We want to empower UCSD homeless youth to seek out appropriate resources and be more open about their needs</li>
								<li> Students struggling with food, finances, and housing instability are stigmatized. </li>
								<li> UCSD's plethora of resources for those who are homeless or struggle with food insecurity are scattered and decentralized. </li>
								<li> Lack of support from administration and connection to appropriate services make it difficult for those in need to obtain valuable information.</li>

						<h2>Inspiration and Ideation</h2>

						 <p> In order to centralize UCSD basic needs resources and help destigmatize homelessness and the issue of basic needs on campus, my team members came up with several ideas. We thought of creating some sort of tool that could customize to ther user's needs and help to centralize the resources on campus so that the user knows exactly where to look to find what they need. We were reminded of beauty subscription boxes such as ipsy.com, Julep, and Sephora that created boxes of beauty goodies that were tailored to the customer's makeup preferences. We also thought of the use of vending machines that were supplied with simple hygienic products, similar to how campus had vending machines for school supplies. We thought of murals, and social media campaigns such as Humans of New York, to help generate a positive conversation that would help to normalize stigmatized topics such as homelessness.</p>

						  <p> We eventually narrowed down our ideas to creating a mural in a high foot-traffic space, a social media campaign, and a survey website for The Hub, a basic needs campus space. </p>

						 	Using Sketch, I and other team member made several iterations of the user interface for the website. We made several different kinds of templates since survey questions can come in multiple choice, checklist, ranking, and fill-in-the-blank formats. </p>
